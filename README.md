# HOG-and-PCA
This module contains different methods for feature Extraction and Dimensionality reduction:

The method ComputeHog is to extract meaningful features from images by using Histogram of Oriented Gradient. The parameters can be provided externally in order to compute the Hog descriptors.

The second method ComputePCA is used to depreciate the selected feature from high-dimensional space to low-dimensional space. The basic idea behind this approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to increase the performance of the model.
